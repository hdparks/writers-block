# writers-block

An Open-Source platform for building a kick-ass writing club

# Vision

You and your trusty companions want to start a writing club. But throwing new chapters in the group chat is quickly going to get on everyone's nerves. 
You need a place to store your stories. Even better, you need a place to store the conversations, the reactions, and the sweet, sweet validation you feel when someone connects with something you've created.
You need Writer's Block!
(Working title, obviously, it's the literal worst name for what it's trying to be.)
